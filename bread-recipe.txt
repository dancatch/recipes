Ingredients:
 - 3 cups strong flour
 - 1 cup warm water @45 degrees C
 - 1/2 teaspoon salt
 - 2 teaspoon sugar
 - 2 table spoon oil / butter
 - 7g fast acting yeast

Directions:
1. Put the flour in the bread maker first.
2. Put the salt and sugar in one corner on top of the flour, make a well so that the salt will not move around when water is added.
3. Put the yeast in the opposite corner on top of the flour in a well. 
Try to keep the salt away from the yeast as the salt will kill the yeast.
4. Add the oil or butter to the breadmaker.
5. Pour in the water, make sure it is not opver 45degC as it will kill the yeast if too hot.
6. Turn on the breadmaker and let it run a standard bread program. 

It is OK to mix the flour 2 cups strong bread flour to 1 cup plain flour if you have a lot of plain flour to use up.

Out of date yeast will not work properly as some of it will be dead already, use a good quality yeast.
